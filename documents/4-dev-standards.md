## title: Development Standards

# Development Standards

## Overview

This document defines comprehensive development standards applicable to any software project. It aims to ensure consistency, maintainability, and effective collaboration across all contributors.

---

## Branching Strategy

* **Main / Master**: Always production-ready; stable releases only.
* **Develop**: Integration branch for ongoing development and feature consolidation.
* **Feature branches**: `feature/<short-description>` for individual new features.
* **Bugfix branches**: `bugfix/<short-description>` for resolving issues.
* **Hotfix branches**: `hotfix/<short-description>` for urgent production fixes.
* Branch names should be clear, concise, and follow a consistent pattern.

---

## Commit Guidelines

* Follow **conventional commits**: `type(scope): concise description`.

  * Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.
* Commits should be small, focused, and atomic.
* Include context or rationale when necessary.
* Avoid bundling unrelated changes in a single commit.
* Amend minor mistakes rather than creating multiple trivial commits.

---

## Code Style

* Adhere to language-specific style guides (ESLint, PEP8, etc.).
* Use automated formatting tools (Prettier, Black) when possible.
* Maintain consistent naming, indentation, and code organization.
* Include inline documentation for complex logic.
* Prioritize readability, maintainability, and simplicity.

### Naming Conventions

#### TypeScript / JavaScript

* Variables and functions: `camelCase`
* Classes and components: `PascalCase`
* Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

#### Python

* Variables and functions: `snake_case`
* Classes: `PascalCase`
* Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

### File Organization

* Group related files into directories (e.g., `components`, `services`, `utils`).
* Filenames should be descriptive, lowercase, and use hyphens: `<description>.ext`.
* Maintain a structure that mirrors project architecture.
* Place tests in a dedicated `tests` or `__tests__` folder, mirroring source structure.
* Use index files (`index.ts`, `__init__.py`) for convenient imports when appropriate.

---

## Testing

* Implement **unit tests** for all new functionality.
* Include **integration tests** for interactions between multiple components.
* Ensure tests pass before merging into main branches.
* Utilize CI pipelines to automate testing and enforce standards.
* Document test procedures, expected outcomes, and edge cases.

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

* Target the appropriate branch based on the type of work.
* Provide clear descriptions, context, and rationale for changes.
* Link related issues, tickets, or tasks.
* Ensure all tests pass before requesting review.
* Assign reviewers and address feedback promptly.

---

## Version Control Best Practices

* Maintain a clean, readable, and traceable commit history.
* Sign commits whenever possible.
* Keep branches in sync to minimize merge conflicts.
* Use meaningful tags and version numbers for releases.
* Maintain a changelog documenting major changes.

---

## Key Principles

* **Consistency**: Apply the same standards across all contributors.
* **Clarity**: Ensure code, commits, and PRs are understandable.
* **Quality**: Uphold high standards in code, testing, and documentation.
* **Collaboration**: Communicate effectively and review contributions respectfully.
* **Security**: Verify dependencies, manage credentials safely, and enforce best practices.
