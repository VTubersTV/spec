# General Documentation Standards

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for creating, maintaining, and organizing documentation for any project. Following these standards ensures consistency, readability, and accessibility for all contributors and users.

---

## File Organization

* Store documents in a dedicated `docs`, `documents`, or similar folder at the project root.
* Use clear, descriptive filenames in lowercase with hyphens: `<number>-<short-description>.md`.

  * Examples: `1-introduction.md`, `2-api-reference.md`, `3-guidelines.md`.
* Group related documents in subfolders if necessary, such as `/architecture`, `/guides`, `/tutorials`.
* Maintain a logical numbering or ordering system to reflect hierarchy and reading sequence.

---

## Document Structure

* Each document should start with a header containing metadata:

```
---
title: Document Title
layout: default
nav_order: <number>
created: YYYY-MM-DD
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

* Use headings consistently:

  * `#` for main titles
  * `##` for major sections
  * `###` for subsections
* Include a table of contents for long documents.
* Use short paragraphs, bullet points, and numbered lists for clarity.

---

## Formatting and Style

* Use **Markdown** as the primary format.
* Keep language concise, professional, and neutral.
* Avoid jargon unless necessary; provide explanations when used.
* Highlight important terms using bold or italics.
* Use code blocks for commands, snippets, or configuration examples.
* Use relative links for internal references and descriptive text for external links.

---

## Versioning and Updates

* Include `Created` and `Last Updated` dates in headers.
* Maintain a changelog or version history for major document updates.
* Clearly indicate when content has been revised, added, or removed.
* Align documentation versions with project versioning when applicable.

---

## Visuals and Diagrams

* Use diagrams (Mermaid, flowcharts, UML, or images) to explain workflows, architecture, or processes.
* Label all visuals clearly and provide captions or descriptions.
* Keep diagrams simple and modular for easy understanding.
* Ensure diagrams are updated when processes or systems change.

---

## Review and Maintenance

* All documentation should be reviewed by at least one knowledgeable team member before publishing.
* Encourage feedback and contributions through pull requests, issues, or discussion channels.
* Schedule regular reviews to ensure accuracy and relevance.
* Deprecate or archive outdated documents with clear notices.

---

## Key Principles

* **Consistency**: Uniform structure, style, and formatting across all documents.
* **Clarity**: Easy to read and understand for both new and experienced users.
* **Accessibility**: Documents should be structured for readability and navigability.
* **Transparency**: Clearly reflect current project state and updates.
* **Maintainability**: Easy to update, version, and track changes over time.


## Accessibility

* Ensure all documentation is usable by people with disabilities.
* Use descriptive alt text for images and diagrams.
* Structure content with semantic headings and lists for screen readers.
* Avoid color as the only means of conveying information.
* Provide sufficient contrast and readable font sizes in visuals.

---

## Localization and Internationalization

* Write documentation in clear, simple language to facilitate translation.
* Avoid idioms, slang, or culturally specific references.
* Use tools or workflows that support translation and localization when needed.
* Mark untranslated or machine-translated content clearly.

---

## API Documentation

* Document all public APIs with clear descriptions, parameters, return values, and examples.
* Use consistent formatting for code samples and endpoint references.
* Indicate deprecated endpoints or parameters.
* Link to related resources or reference materials.

---

## Security and Privacy

* Avoid including sensitive information (passwords, secrets, personal data) in documentation.
* Clearly mark any example data as fictitious.
* Document security considerations and best practices where relevant.
* Follow project or organizational privacy guidelines for documentation.

---

## Contribution Guidelines

* Provide clear instructions for contributing to documentation (style, process, review).
* Use templates for issues and pull requests related to docs.
* Encourage contributors to update or add documentation with code changes.
* Recognize and credit documentation contributors where possible.
